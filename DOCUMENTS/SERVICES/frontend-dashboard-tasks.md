# Frontend Dashboard Plan (Draft)

Intended final location: `DOCUMENTS/DEVELOPMENT/frontend-dashboard-tasks.md`

## Objective
Deliver an interactive dashboard for exploring processed data (sentiment, topics, alerts) with real-time updates, strong performance, and accessibility.

## Architecture Snapshot
Stack: React (or Next.js), Component Library (MUI/Chakra or custom), State (Query library + lightweight global store), Real-time (WebSocket/SSE), Auth (JWT via Gateway), Theming (light/dark), Build (Vite/Next).

## Core Views
- Stream View (live feed of processed items)
- Insights Overview (sentiment distribution, top aspects/topics)
- Detail Drilldown (document or event timeline)
- Alerts Management (subscriptions, history)
- Settings (feature flags, API keys placeholder)

## Phase Breakdown
### Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2) Foundation
- Repo scaffold & tooling (lint, format, test) (Week1)
- Auth integration (login flow, token refresh) (Week1-2)
- Global layout (nav, header, responsive grid) (Week1)
- Theme system (light/dark) + switch (Week1)
- Error boundary + fallback UI (Week2)
- Basic Stream View static mock (Week2)

### Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4) Data & Real-Time
- API client abstraction (typed) (Week3)
- Real-time connection (SSE or WS) baseline (Week3)
- Live feed integration (virtualized list) (Week3-4)
- Insights placeholders (charts scaffolds) (Week4)
- Loading skeleton components (Week3)
- Access control wrappers (roles) (Week4)

### Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6) Visualization & UX
- Sentiment trend chart (time series)
- Topic distribution chart
- Aspect heatmap/table
- Alert subscription UI (create/edit)
- Drilldown modal/page (document + metadata)
- Keyboard navigation & a11y audit fixes

### Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8) Performance & Hardening
- Performance budget checks (LCP, CLS instrumentation)
- Code splitting & route-based chunks
- Prefetch strategies (hover/intention)
- Offline fallback (service worker minimal)
- SSO integration option
- UI test coverage expansion (critical flows)

### Phase 5 (Weeks 9-10) Polish & Enhancements
- Theming extension (high contrast)
- User preferences persistence
- Feature flag driven experiments panel
- Advanced filtering (facet + search)
- Internationalization groundwork

## Non-Functional Requirements
- LCP ≤ 2.5s on median hardware
- Lighthouse Performance ≥ 85 initial
- Accessible color contrast (WCAG AA)
- Real-time latency < 2s from backend event

## Testing Strategy
- Unit: pure components + utils
- Integration: API client hooks + mock server
- E2E: critical flows (login, view feed, set alert)
- Performance: Lighthouse CI in pipeline

## Metrics & Observability
- Web vitals (FID, LCP, CLS) -> analytics endpoint
- User interaction events (anonymized) for feature adoption
- Error boundary counts by feature area

## Security
- Token stored in memory (avoid localStorage if possible)
- CSP headers (script-src 'self') via Gateway config
- Input sanitization (dangerous HTML rendering avoided)

## Risks
- Real-time performance: mitigate with virtualization & batching
- Chart rendering overhead: lazy load heavy libs
- Auth complexity with expiring tokens: central refresh logic
